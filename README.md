# JFChatColors
Adds a configurable chat format that can display the `/scoreboard` team and can use the `/scoreboard` team color.
Also adds a `/friendlyfire` command to toggle the `/scoreboard` team friendlyfire option of your own team and a `/collisionRule` command to change the collision rule of the own `/scoreboard` team with no permission requirements (don't need to be OP to execute).

The chat format in single player may be buggy.
